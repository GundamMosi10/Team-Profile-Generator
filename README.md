  ## Test: 
  There are tests associated with this project. To run tests for this project you are going to need to run 'jest' in the command line of terminal or gitbash. First you are going to install 'jest' in the command line with the code: npm install jest, now that we have it installed we need to look inside of the package.json under the 'scripts' tag to add the code: "test": "jest /*", this will allow us to run the tests. Now to run the tests themselves, kill the integrated terminal if you have one open. Then you want to 'right-click' on package.json and scroll down to 'open in integrated terminal. Once open type the command: 'npm install jest' just to make sure that it is there and now type in the command: 'npm run test' this should fire the test and you should see that all of them have passed.
